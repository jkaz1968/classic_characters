Classic Traveller Character Creator

Generates random characters for the original Traveller game developed by Mark Miller in 1977.
Character stats were defined by a six-digit Universal Personality Profile or UPP, as explained:
Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, Social Standing
Each stat is rated from 2 to 15 (2 to F in the final form) and initial values are generated by
rolling 2x six-sided dice.

Characters are presumed to be adults, typically on their own following a military or other
professional career, with nothing better to do than explore the galaxy and look for fame and
fortune.

Professions are defined in modules, each named for the professional classes outlined in Book 1
Characters and Combat, and Supplement 4 Citizens of the Imperium.

At the end of each character creation sequence, you will be given the chance to save the character
to a text file. These saves are kept in the same directory as the program files, under "Characters".

You may copy, use, hack, modify, or kludge this software to your heart's content but please don't
sell it. You got it free, so give it to someone else who plays and loves Traveller.

*** One important note: The program allows you to save characters that you like (or don't like) to a 
text file. Before you do this, you'll need to create a "Characters" directory in the installation
location or it will fail. Thanks!
